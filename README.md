# Coursera SpaceX Capstone Project
Welcome to the repository for the Coursera SpaceX Capstone Project! This project is part of the Coursera specialization and serves as a culmination of the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course.

Project Description
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launchThe Coursera SpaceX Capstone Project focuses on simulating the launch trajectory of SpaceX rockets. The goal is to develop a program that can accurately predict the trajectory of a rocket launch based on various parameters such as rocket specifications, environmental factors, and mission objectives.

The project involves several key components:

Rocket Model: Implement a realistic model of a SpaceX rocket, considering its physical characteristics, propulsion system, and control mechanisms.

Environmental Factors: Account for various environmental factors that affect the trajectory, such as atmospheric conditions, wind, and gravity.

Launch Simulation: Develop a simulation program that integrates the rocket model and environmental factors to simulate the trajectory of the rocket launch.

Data Visualization: Create visualizations to display the simulated trajectory, allowing for easy analysis and comparison of different launch scenarios.
